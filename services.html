        <h2 class="background-text">Photography Background</h2>
        <p class="background-text">Growing up, I had two main interests being weather & transportation. When I bought my first camera in high school, I wanted to photograph my interests to demonstrate the beauty and difficulty in both hobbies. The placement of the subjects that I photograph are all out of my control, which brings an exciting and ever-changing element to this type of photography. The end result has gotten me published nationally (and regionally), has gotten me a scholarship, and continues to push me to improve and expand upon what I photograph daily. As of 2021, I have ample experience working at Clarkson University photographing different events, as well as drone photography.</p>
